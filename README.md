Just like the name suggests, this is a small game/demo of an AR shooter made for the Meta Quest 3. It was made utilizing the great cameras from the device, as well as its amazing AR features,
In combination with some special shaders and Unity tooling.

The code based is fairly well structured. It is robust, reusable and decoupled with customizability of various gameplay or visual elements in the inspector.

*DISCLAIMER* :  None of the assets or textures used were made by me. They were dowloaded from freesound.org(for sounds) and Sketchfab(for 3D models and their respective textures);
                I am not the creator of the special shaders used for passthrough capabilities.
